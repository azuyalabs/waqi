## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you would like to report a vulnerability or have any security concerns with this project,
please [open an issue](https://github.com/azuyalabs/waqi/issues/new?labels=security).

To investigate your request as good as possible, please include any of the following when reporting:

- Proof of concept / Code example

- Any relevant output

I will take all disclosures very seriously and will do my best to rapidly respond and verify the vulnerability before
taking the necessary steps to fix it. After my initial reply to your disclosure, which should be directly after
receiving it, I will periodically update you with the status of the fix.
